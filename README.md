  ## Description
  For this project I was instructed to make a team profile generator using using the inquirer npm package and jest to test the code. Users will initiate the prompts by entering 'node index'. From there they will fill out the questions about their team manager and other chosen employees. When they select finish, a HTML file is created with all the information they submitted on styled profile cards. This challenge helped me better understand how to use inquirer to create specific prompts to gather and validate information, and how to test code using jest. This assignment also helped me to better understand the relationship of front end and back end code.
  
  ## Installation Instructions
  The user should enter in npm i to download any required packages.
